# Synopsis

A simple script to scrape for Tweets using the Python package requests to
retrieve the content and Beautifullsoup4 to parse the retrieved content.


# 1. Motivation
Twitter has provided [REST API's](https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public) which can
be used by developers to access and read Twitter data. They have also provided
a [Streaming API](https://dev.twitter.com/streaming/overview) which can be used
to access Twitter Data in real-time.

Most of the software written to access Twitter data provide a library which
functions as a wrapper around Twitters Search and Streaming API's and therefore
are limited by the limitations of the API's.

With Twitter's Search API you can only sent 180 Requests every 15 minutes. With
a maximum number of 100 tweets per Request this means you can mine for
4 x 180 x 100 = 72.000 tweets per hour. By using TwitterScraper you are not
limited by this number but by your internet speed/bandwith and the number of
instances of TwitterScraper you are willing to start.


One of the bigger disadvantages of the Search API is that you can only access
Tweets written in the **past 7 days**. This is a major bottleneck for anyone
looking for older past data to make a model from. With TwitterScraper there is
no such limitation.

Per Tweet it scrapes the following information:
+ Username and Full Name
+ Tweet-id
+ Tweet-url
+ Tweet text
+ Tweet timestamp
+ No. of likes
+ No. of replies
+ No. of retweets
 

# 2. Installation and Usage

To install **twitterscraper**:

```python
(sudo) pip install twitterscraper
```

or you can clone the repository and in the folder containing setup.py

```python
python setup.py install
```

## 2.2 The CLI

You can use the command line application to get your tweets stored to JSON
right away. 
Twitterscraper takes several arguments:

- `-h` or `--help`
Print out the help message and exits.

- `-l` or `--limit`
TwitterScraper stops scraping when *at least* the number of tweets indicated with `--limit` is scraped. 
Since tweets are retrieved in batches of 20, this will always be a multiple of 20. 

    Omit the limit to retrieve all tweets. You can at any time abort the scraping
by pressing Ctrl+C, the scraped tweets will be stored safely in your JSON file.
  
- `--lang`
Retrieves tweets written in a specific language. Currently 30+ languages are supported. For a full list of the languages print out the help message.

- `-bd` or `--begindate`
Set the date from which TwitterScraper should start scraping for your query. Format is YYYY-MM-DD. The default value is set to 2017-01-01.

- `-ed` or `--enddate`
Set the enddate which TwitterScraper should use to stop scraping for your query. Format is YYYY-MM-DD. The default value is set to today.

- `-p` or `--poolsize`
Set the number of parallel processes TwitterScraper should initiate while scraping for your query. Default value is set to 20.
Depending on the computational power you have, you can increase this number.
It is advised to keep this number below half of the number of days you are scraping.
For example, if you are scraping from 2017-01-10 to 2017-01-20, you can set this number to a maximum of 5.
If you are scraping from 2016-01-01 to 2016-12-31, you can increase this number to a maximum of 150, if you have the computational resources.


- `-o` or `--output`
Gives the name of the output file. If no output filename is given, the default filename 'tweets.json' will be used. 

- `-d` or `--dump`:
With this argument, the scraped tweets will be printed to the screen instead of an outputfile. 
If you are using this argument, the `--output` argument doe not need to be used. 


### 2.2.1 Examples of simple queries

Below is an example of how twitterscraper can be used:

`twitterscraper Trump --limit 100 --output=tweets.json`

`twitterscraper Trump -l 100 -o tweets.json`

`twitterscraper Trump -l 100 -bd 2017-01-01 -ed 2017-06-01 -o tweets.json`



### 2.2.2 Examples of advanced queries
You can use any advanced query Twitter supports. An advanced query should be placed within quotes,
so that twitterscraper can recognize it as one single query.

Here are some examples:

+ search for the occurence of 'Bitcoin' or 'BTC': ```twitterscraper "Bitcoin OR BTC " -o bitcoin_tweets.json -l 1000```
+ search for the occurence of 'Bitcoin' and 'BTC': ```twitterscraper "Bitcoin AND BTC " -o bitcoin_tweets.json -l 1000```
+ search for tweets from a specific user: ```twitterscraper "Blockchain from:VitalikButerin" -o blockchain_tweets.json -l 1000```
+ search for tweets to a specific user: ```twitterscraper "Blockchain to:VitalikButerin" -o blockchain_tweets.json -l 1000```
+ search for tweets written from a location: ```twitterscraper "Blockchain near:Seattle within:15mi" -o blockchain_tweets.json -l 1000```



## 2.3 From within Python
You can easily use TwitterScraper from within python:
```
from twitterscraper import query_tweets

if __name__ == '__main__':
    list_of_tweets = query_tweets("Trump OR Clinton", 10)
    #print the retrieved tweets to the screen:
    for tweet in query_tweets("Trump OR Clinton", 10):
        print(tweet)
    
    #Or save the retrieved tweets to file:
    file = open(“output.txt”,”w”) 
    for tweet in query_tweets("Trump OR Clinton", 10):
        file.write(tweet.encode('utf-8')) 
    file.close()

```

# 3. Output

All of the retrieved Tweets are stored in the indicated output file. The contents of the output file will look like:
```
[{"fullname": "Rupert Meehl", "id": "892397793071050752", "likes": "1", "replies": "0", "retweets": "0", "text": "Latest: Trump now at lowest Approval and highest Disapproval ratings yet. Oh, we're winning bigly here ...\n\nhttps://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings/?ex_cid=rrpromo\u00a0\u2026", "timestamp": "2017-08-01T14:53:08", "user": "Rupert_Meehl"}, {"fullname": "Barry Shapiro", "id": "892397794375327744", "likes": "0", "replies": "0", "retweets": "0", "text": "A former GOP Rep quoted this line, which pretty much sums up Donald Trump. https://twitter.com/davidfrum/status/863017301595107329\u00a0\u2026", "timestamp": "2017-08-01T14:53:08", "user": "barryshap"}, (...)
]
```

## 3.1 Opening the output file
In order to correctly handle all possible characters in the tweets (think of chinese or arabic characters), the output is saved as utf-8 encoded bytes. That is why you could see text like ""\u30b1\u30f3\u3055\u307e\u30fe ..." in the output file. 

What you should do is open the file with the proper encoding:

# TO DO

- Add caching potentially? Would be nice to be able to resume scraping if
  something goes wrong and have half of the data of a request cached or so.
- Add an example of using a thread pool/asynchio for gathering more tweets in
  parallel.
- Use RegExp for retrieving the information from the scraped page (instead of Beautifullsoup4). 
  This might solve the problem of the HTML parser not working properly on some linux distributions.
